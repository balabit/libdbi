	<Abstract>
	<Para>
		libdbi implements a database-independent abstraction layer in C,
		similar to the DBI/DBD layer in Perl. Writing one generic set of code,
		programmers can leverage the power of multiple databases and multiple
		simultaneous database connections by using this framework.

		<Para>
			libdbi provides application developers with a database independent abstraction
			layer for C. It handles the database-specific implementations for each type of
			database, so that you can use the same exact code with any type of database
			server that libdbi supports. You can initiate and use multiple database
			connections simultaneously, regardless of the types of database you are
			connecting to. The plugin architecture allows for new database drivers to be
			easily added dynamically by a third party.
