	<Abstract>
	<Para>
		libdbi implements a database-independent abstraction layer in C,
		similar to the DBI/DBD layer in Perl. Writing one generic set of code,
		programmers can leverage the power of multiple databases and multiple
		simultaneous database connections by using this framework.

<Chapter id="intro"><Title>Introduction</Title>
	<Section id="description"><Title>Description</Title>
		<Para>
			libdbi provides application developers with a database independent abstraction
			layer for C. It handles the database-specific implementations for each type of
			database, so that you can use the same exact code with any type of database server
			that libdbi supports. You can initiate and use multiple database connections
			simultaneously, regardless of the types of database servers you are connecting to.
			The plugin architecture allows for new database drivers to be easily added
			dynamically by a third party.
		</Para>
	</Section>
	<Section id="terminology"><Title>libdbi Concepts and Terminology</Title>
		<Para>
			In this guide, the terms <Quote>user</Quote> and <Quote>programmer</Quote> are used
			interchangably, since the target audience is the software developer using libdbi in
			his program. The libdbi architecture provides serveral <Quote>plugins</Quote>, one
			for each type of database server. All plugins are loaded into memory upon libdbi
			initiallization and made available to the programmer. Once a plugin is
			<Emphasis>instantiated</Emphasis>, it represents a distinct database session and is
			called a <Quote>driver</Quote>. Multiple drivers may exist for a single plugin, and
			all will function independently of each other.
