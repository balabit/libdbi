    <Abstract>
      <Para>
	libdbi implements a database-independent abstraction layer in C,
	similar to the DBI/DBD layer in Perl. Writing one generic set of code,
	programmers can leverage the power of multiple databases and multiple
	simultaneous database connections by using this framework.
      </Para>

  <Chapter id="intro"><Title>Introduction</Title>
    <Section id="description"><Title>Description</Title>
      <Para>
	libdbi provides application developers with a database independent abstraction
	layer for C. It handles the database-specific implementations for each type of
	database, so that you can use the same exact code with any type of database server
	that libdbi supports. You can initiate and use multiple database connections
	simultaneously, regardless of the types of database servers you are connecting to.
	The driver architecture allows for new database drivers to be easily added
	dynamically.
      </Para>
    </Section>
    <Section id="terminology"><Title>libdbi Concepts and Terminology</Title>
      <Para>
	In this guide, the terms <Quote>user</Quote> and <Quote>programmer</Quote> are used
	interchangably, since the target audience is the software developer using libdbi in
	his program. The libdbi architecture provides serveral <Quote>drivers</Quote>, one
	for each type of database server. All drivers are loaded into memory upon libdbi
	initiallization and are made available to the programmer. Once a driver is
	<Emphasis>instantiated</Emphasis>, it represents a distinct database session and is
	called a <Quote>connection</Quote>. Multiple connections may exist for a single driver, and
	all will function independently of each other. A star character (*) represents a
	wildcard matching any letters. For example, <Quote>dbi_conn_*</Quote> would
	represent all functions beginning with <Quote>dbi_conn_</Quote>.
