	<Abstract>
	<Para>
		libdbi implements a database-independent abstraction layer in C,
		similar to the DBI/DBD layer in Perl. Writing one generic set of code,
		programmers can leverage the power of multiple databases and multiple
		simultaneous database connections by using this framework.

<Chapter id="intro"><Title>Introduction</Title>
	<Section id="description"><Title>Description</Title>
		<Para>
			libdbi provides application developers with a database independent abstraction
			layer for C. It handles the database-specific implementations for each type of
			database, so that you can use the same exact code with any type of database server
			that libdbi supports. You can initiate and use multiple database connections
			simultaneously, regardless of the types of database servers you are connecting to.
			The plugin architecture allows for new database drivers to be easily added
			dynamically by a third party.
		</Para>

	<Section id="terminology"><Title>libdbi Concepts and Terminology</Title>
		<Para>
			In this guide, the terms <Term>user</Term> and <Term>programmer</Term> are used
			interchangably, since the target audience is the software developer using libdbi in
			his program. The libdbi architecture provides serveral <Quote>plugins</Quote>, one
			for each type of database server. All plugins are loaded into memory upon libdbi
			initiallization and made available to the programmer. Once a plugin is
			<Emphasis>instantiated</Emphasis>, it represents a distinct database session and is
			called a <Quote>driver</Quote>. Multiple drivers may exist for a single plugin, and
			all will function independantly of each other.

<Chapter id="quickstart"><Title>libdbi in a Nutshell (Quickstart Guide)</Title>
	<Section id="quickstart-debriefing"><Title>Quick Overview</Title>
		<Para>
			libdbi uses a plugin system that allows various databases to be
			supported simultaneously, and can dynamically load or unload
			plugins that are supplied by libdbi or a third-party. The library
			is initiallized by calling <Literal><XRef
			linkend="dbi-initialize"></Literal> and a plugin instance (a
			driver) is started by calling either <Literal><XRef
			linkend="dbi-load-driver"></Literal> or both <Literal><XRef
			linkend="dbi-open-plugin"></Literal> and <Literal><XRef
			linkend="dbi-start-driver"></Literal>. The driver's options such as
			username, password, hostname, and database name are set with
			<Literal><XRef linkend="dbi-set-option"></Literal> and
			<Literal><XRef linkend="dbi-set-option-numeric"></Literal>. Once
			all options are set, <Literal><XRef
			linkend="dbi-connect"></Literal> will connect to the database
			(returning -1 in case of an error), waiting to handle a
			<Literal><XRef linkend="dbi-query"></Literal>. After a successful
			query, <Literal><XRef linkend="dbi-fetch-row"></Literal> will
			retrieve the next matched row, which can be passed on to one of the
			field-fetching functions: <Literal><XRef
			linkend="dbi-get-byte"></Literal>, <Literal><XRef
			linkend="dbi-get-short"></Literal>, <Literal><XRef
			linkend="dbi-get-long"></Literal>, <Literal><XRef
			linkend="dbi-get-longlong"></Literal>, <Literal><XRef
			linkend="dbi-get-ubyte"></Literal> (unsigned), <Literal><XRef
			linkend="dbi-get-ushort"></Literal> (unsigned), <Literal><XRef
			linkend="dbi-get-ulong"></Literal> (unsigned), <Literal><XRef
			linkend="dbi-get-ulonglong"></Literal> (unsigned), <Literal><XRef
			linkend="dbi-get-float"></Literal>, <Literal><XRef
			linkend="dbi-get-double"></Literal>, <Literal><XRef
			linkend="dbi-get-string"></Literal>, <Literal><XRef
			linkend="dbi-get-binary"></Literal>, <Literal><XRef
			linkend="dbi-get-string-copy"></Literal>, <Literal><XRef
			linkend="dbi-get-binary-copy"></Literal>, <Literal><XRef
			linkend="dbi-get-enum"></Literal>, or <Literal><XRef
			linkend="dbi-get-set"></Literal>. When using the string or binary
			functions, the programmer must not modify the returned data, since
			it is managed by libdbi and may be inaccessible after the next
			fetched row. If the data must be modified or must be managed by the
			program itself, <Literal><XRef linkend="dbi-get-string-copy">
			</Literal> and <Literal><XRef linkend="dbi-get-binary-copy">
			</Literal> will return a copy of the data for the program to use.
			Memory allocated by these two functions must be manually freed by
			the program. For string and binary fields, <Literal><XRef
			linkend="dbi-get-length"></Literal> will return the length in
			characters of a particular field. For other types of fields,
			<Literal><XRef linkend="dbi-get-size"></Literal> will return the
			size in bytes of a particular field's type. Before the next
			database operation is performed, <Literal><XRef
			linkend="dbi-free-query"></Literal> must be called to free internal
			variables.  Before the program terminates, the driver must be
			disconnected and unloaded with <Literal><XRef
			linkend="dbi-close-driver"></Literal> and libdbi must be unloaded
			with <Literal><XRef linkend="dbi-shutdown"></Literal>.
		</Para>
		<Para>
			As an alternative to calling the dbi_get_TYPENAME functions after
			every fetched row, you can also <Quote>bind</Quote> variables to
			database fields so that libdbi updates the variables automatically.
			Any desired bindings must be set before <Literal><XRef
			linkend="dbi-fetch-row"></Literal> is called. To unbind a field,
			specify <Literal>NULL</Literal> as the destination variable's
			pointer.
