	<Abstract>
	<Para>
		libdbi implements a database-independent abstraction layer in C,
		similar to the DBI/DBD layer in Perl. Writing one generic set of code,
		programmers can leverage the power of multiple databases and multiple
		simultaneous database connections by using this framework.
	</Para>
	<Para>
		This guide explains the internal DBD interface for libdbi drivers, and
		provides a reference for all available driver helper functions.

	<Section id="description"><Title>Description</Title>
		<Para>
			libdbi provides application developers with a database independent abstraction
			layer for C. It handles the database-specific implementations for each type of
			database, so that you can use the same exact code with any type of database server
			that libdbi supports. You can initiate and use multiple database connections
			simultaneously, regardless of the types of database servers you are connecting to.
			The plugin architecture allows for new database drivers to be easily added
			dynamically by a third party.
