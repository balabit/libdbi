- a better way of handling query() vs. efficient_query()
- sanity-check arguments, don't call dbd functions if an invalid plugin/driver was specified
- prepare precompiled redhat packages (and test/fix debian packages)
- plugins:
	* mysql (finish plugin and run stress tests)
	* msql
	* postgresql
	* oracle
	* others?
- create a config.h and use it to determine datatype information (how many bits an 'int' is, etc. mainly for portability to non-lintel systems)
- more advanced plugin capabilities struct?
