INCLUDED PLUGINS:
-----------------

 * mysql
   (maintained by Mark M. Tobenkin)
   MySQL Database Plugin (using libmysqlclient6)
   
 * pgsql
   (maintained by David A. Parker)
   PostgreSQL Database Plugin (using libpq)

OVERALL NOTES:
--------------

These common options are recognized by all plugins:
 * host
 * port
 * username
 * password
 * dbname

All plugin-specific options are prefixed by the plugin's name, e.g.
"mysql_compression" or "pgsql_tty".


MYSQL NOTES:
------------

Fields passed through the UNIX_TIMESTAMP() function are returned as unsigned
long long, not as unsigned long. When using the SUM() aggregate function, the
resulting value is returned as a double. All unrecognized datatypes are
preserved as strings.


POSTGRESQL NOTES:
-----------------

PostgreSQL has no intrinsic concept of unsigned fields (although you can still
use the "OID" type as an unsigned long, or define your own user-defined
unsigned types).  User-defined types are not handled specially. All
unrecognized datatypes are preserved as strings.
